Script Name: captive_portal_login.py
Description: This script uses Selenium to automate login to a captive portal on a Linux server.
             It is designed to be used with a cron job for maintaining a stable network connection.
Author: AI Assistant
Date: 2024-02-08
Version: 1.1 (Enhanced CLI Output)
Dependencies:
    - Python 3
    - Selenium (pip install selenium)
    - ChromeDriver (install via apt: `sudo apt install chromium-driver`)
    - crontab (for scheduling)
    - (Optional) Xvfb (for running Chrome in headless mode on a server: `sudo apt install xvfb`)

Configuration:
    1.  Install the dependencies listed above.
    2.  Configure the script variables below (USERNAME, PASSWORD, URL, etc.).
    3.  (Optional) If running on a server without a display, uncomment and configure the Xvfb section.
    4.  Schedule the script to run periodically using cron (see crontab instructions below).

Usage:
    1.  Save the script to a file (e.g., captive_portal_login.py).
    2.  Make the script executable: `chmod +x captive_portal_login.py`
    3.  Configure the script variables:
        -   USERNAME: The username for the captive portal.
        -   PASSWORD: The password for the captive portal.
        -   URL: The URL of the captive portal login page.  If you don't know the URL,
                 the script can try to find it, but it's more reliable if you provide it.
        -   HEADLESS:  Set to True to run Chrome in headless mode (recommended for servers).
        -   CHROME_PATH: (Optional) If Chrome is not in the default location, provide the full path
                         to the Chrome executable.
        -   CHROMEDRIVER_PATH: (Optional) If chromedriver is not in the system PATH, provide the full path.
    4.  (Optional) If running headless, ensure Xvfb is set up correctly.
    5.  Test the script manually: `./captive_portal_login.py`
    6.  Schedule the script with cron (see below).

Crontab Instructions:
    1.  Open the crontab editor: `crontab -e`
    2.  Add a line to schedule the script (e.g., to run every 30 minutes):
        `*/30 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/captive_portal_login.py > /var/log/captive_portal_login.log 2>&1`
        -   Replace `/usr/bin/python3` with the actual path to your Python 3 executable.
        -   Replace `/path/to/captive_portal_login.py` with the actual path to your script.
        -   `> /var/log/captive_portal_login.log 2>&1` redirects output and errors to a log file.  This is highly recommended.
    3.  Save and exit the crontab editor.

Notes:
    -   This script requires network connectivity to function.
    -   The script assumes the captive portal login form has input fields with IDs
        "username" and "password", and a submit button.  You may need to modify
        the element selectors (find_element calls) if the actual form is different.
    -   Error handling is included, but captive portals can be unpredictable.  Monitor
        the log file (`/var/log/captive_portal_login.log` if you used the crontab example)
        for any errors.
    -   Running Chrome in headless mode (HEADLESS = True) is recommended for servers
        as it doesn't require a graphical display.  If you encounter issues with headless
        mode, you may need to adjust your Xvfb configuration or try running with a
        visible display (HEADLESS = False).
    -   The script includes a retry mechanism with a 5-second delay and a maximum of 3 attempts.
    -   The script now uses Chrome instead of Firefox, and installs the driver via apt.
